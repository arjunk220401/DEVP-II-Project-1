# DEVP-II-Project-1
The link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lawrencestratvert/kevin-cookie-company-financial-analysis/discussion.
Here I have created two dynamic plots on the Kevin Cookie Company, since the two outputs are not showing in the ipynb file.
I have added ss of the same in my report.
If you want, you can run the same codes in jupyter separately with uplaoding the excel file in the same name as in the repository and can view the graphs and use the play and pause buttons as well.
